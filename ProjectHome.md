GAP (Grid Agents Platform) Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Mobile Agents in Grid Environments.

In order to model and simulate possible sinergies between Mobile Agents technology and Grid Computing, GAP (Grid Agents Platform) a Java library to models the activities of an agent platform (like [JADE](http://jade.tilab.com/)) has been developed. GAP is an abstraction over [GridSim](http://www.gridbus.org/gridsim/), a Java toolkit that can be programmed to simulate a Grid system and which offers support for simulating Computing Elements, Storage Elements, Virtual Organisations, etc.

[A Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/simgap) related to commits, issues and discussions about this project is active too: [simgap Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/simgap).

[GAP (alias simgap) svn repository](http://simgap.googlecode.com/svn/) is a mirror of [master svn repository](https://gap.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gap).

GAP simulation toolkit [main project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gap) is hosted on [Sourceforge hosting](http://sourceforge.net/).
